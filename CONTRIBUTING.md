# How to contribute
If you find any bugs or inconveniences in `tequila` please don't be shy and let us know.
You can do so either by raising an issue here on github or contact us directly.

If you already found a solution you can contribute to `tequila` over a pull-request.
Here is how that works:

1. Make a fork of `tequila` to your own github account.
2. Checkout the `devel` branch and make sure it is up to date with the main [github repository](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/tequila).
3. Create and checkout a new branch from `devel` via `git branch pr-my-branch-name` followed by `git checkout pr-my-branch-name`. By typing `git branch` afterwards you can check which branch is currently checked out on your computer.
4. Introduce changes to the code and commit them with git.
5. Push the changes to *your* github account
6. Log into github and create a pull request to the main [github repository](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/tequila). The pull-request should be directed to the `devel` branch (but we can also change that afterwards).

If you plan to introduce major changes to the base library it can be beneficial to contact us first.
This way we might be able to avoid conflicts before they arise.

If you used `tequila` for your research, feel free to include your algorithms here, either by integrating it into the core libraries or by demonstrating it with a notebook in the tutorials section. If you let us know about it, we will also add your research article in the list of research projects that use tequila (see the github repo
s README).
